The assignments.

Okay, guys, here's how it's set up:
	1. In /u/cs488/information/notes, there is a directory
		svn-assignments
	   that is this svn directory.
	2. There is a separate a0.tex, etc., at the /u/cs488/information/notes
	   level that include a0contents.tex, etc. (actually, there is an
	   a0.texsrc that is used to generate, etc).
	3. The file infoMacros.tex gets generated by the script mkInfoMacros
	   in /u/cs488/information/notes from the Info file in
	   /u/cs488/information.  By using the generated version, you will
	   at least have consistency with the web page, etc.
	4. The Makefile in /u/cs488/information/notes will do it all:
	   it will do an 'svn update', it will generate new a0.tex files
	   (in /u/cs488/information/notes), it will run pdflatex, it will
	   scp everything over to student.cs.
So what are the gotcha's?
	1. mud doesn't have svn.  You *should* be able to run everything on
	   exhaust ("everything" being the makefile in 
	   /u/cs488/information/notes) and have "it all work."
	   Or run it on mud: it does an ssh to exhaust to do the svn update.
	2. exhaust (and probably most linux boxes) have pdflatex doing something
	   slightly different than mud: they appear to default to a headsep of
	   0, causing the header to overlap the text body.  I have added
	   a headsep to all the a0.tex files, so headers could be readded
	   to the version in the svn directory if someone really wants them.
